### **Scrum Events**    
### The Sprint  

Sprints consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

**Sprint Planning**

2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?  
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
Sprint Goal?
