# SwiftLint

This file describes how to set up and integrate SwiftLint into our project.

### How to set up the environment

1. [Install SwiftLint via Homebrew](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#using-homebrew).
2. [Integrate SwiftLint into an Xcode scheme](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#xcode). Just add a new ["Run Script Phase"](https://indiestack.com/2014/12/speeding-up-custom-script-phases/).
3. [Configure SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#configuration) by adding a [.swiftlint.yml](../.swiftlint.yml) file from the directory you'll run SwiftLint from.
