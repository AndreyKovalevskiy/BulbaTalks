### **Scrum Events**    
### The Sprint    

Sprints consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. Sprints are lasting one week.  

**Sprint Planning**  
Sprint Planning is creating Product Backlog items which should be done in Sprint by Development Team to achieve the Sprint Goal.   
Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of two hours for a one-week Sprint.  

Here you can find current status of the Sprint Goal [Sprint notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxbVa85ZyZQN0tlnibdIgxR1PC301dWRXumpPnWi33w/edit)

### Daily Scrum  
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. On the Daily Scrum meeting we discuss the questions in the same way as described in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100).

### Dragging the issue between the columns on [Agile board](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/projects/1)   

Agile board consists of five columns that describe every step of the process: **Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, **In Progress**, **PR**, **Done**.  

**Backlog** - an ordered list of known product requirements.    
**Sprint Backlog** - a set of Backlog issues that are taken in Sprint.    
**In Progress** - the issue is currently being worked on.      
**PR** - the issue is request review from collaborators.      
**Done** - the issues have been completed.  

When dragging issue between the columns on Agile board it changes the status of issue.   
1. When developer assignees issue he dragging it **In Progress**, it means he starts to work.     
1. After the work is done he opens a new PR and requests review from collaborators, it means that the issue can be dragged to **PR**.      
1. If all reviewers approve it and the task will be merged - the task will be dragged in the **Done** section.
