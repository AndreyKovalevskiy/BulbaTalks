### Issues 

1. [How create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)
2. Title:
- Keep your titles short and descriptive.
- Title should always be 50 characters or less.
3. Description:
- Include links to the specific application views you’re describing.
- Context: explain the conditions which led you to write this issue. For example: “Since we’ve moved to the latest version of smth, we’ve experienced a few performance issues (#14 and #15) on production.”
- Use @mentions and references inside of Issues, for notify other GitHub users and teams, and cross-connect issues to each other. Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two, example:
>This is subtask for #2
4. Use color-coded labels, they help us categorize and filter our issues .
5. Add Project in Project section, and issue will be displayed on [Agile board](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/projects/1).
6. Avoid duplication in issues.
7. When you choose an issue, you should add yourself (someone from your team) in the assignees' section.


### Dragging the issue between the columns on [Agile board](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/projects/1).

Each of the step in the process requires 4 statuses: **Sprint Backlog**, **In Progress**, **PR**, **Done**.    
**Sprint Backlog** - the issue is waiting to start.  
**In Progress** - the issue is currently being worked on.  
**PR** - the issue is request review from collaborators.  
**Done** - the issues has been completed.  
When dragging issue between the columns on Agile board it changes the status of issue.   
1. When developer assignees issue he dragging it **In Progress**, it means he start working.   
2. After the work is done he opens a new PR and request review from collaborators, it means that the issue can be dragged to **PR**.    
3. If all reviwers approves it - the task can be dragged in **Done**.  
4. If reviewer request changes, the task will be dragged back to **In Progress**.
