## Work with branches

We use [git-flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).


The central repo holds [two main branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#the-main-branches) with an infinite lifetime:

1.`master`

2.`develop`

As [supporting branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#supporting-branches) we will use branches with limited lifetime: 

1. [Feature branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#feature-branches).

Name brunch as `feature-[issue number]` (for example, `feature-59`)

2. [Release branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#release-branches).

Name branch as `release-[version number in format X.Y+1]` (for example, `release-1.2`)

3. [Hotfix branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#hotfix-branches).

Name branch as `hotfix-[version number in format X.Y.(Z+1)]` (for example, `hotfix-1.0.2`)

## Work with commits

### Commit Message

1. Use the present tense.
2. Start your message with an uppercase letter.
3. Write in English.
4. The first line of your commit message must be maximum 50 characters long. If you need more verbose description, write the first line as a summary, leave a blank line and then start writing the description. Each line in the description should though wrap at the 72nd mark.
5. Use the imperative in the title. For example, you can start the title with these words: Refactor, Update, Remove, Release, Fix, Merge, Rename, etc.

### Operations that are allowed on the commit history

1. Try to avoid using `git commit .`. Instead, try to get into the habit of checking which files are actually changed (with git status), and then add files to your commits explicitly: `git add {file1} {file2}`.
2. For local repository!! If you’ve created a commit already, but then you do more work that should logically be included in that same commit, you can simply add new work to the previous commit with `git commit --amend`.

## Work with versions

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Work with testing

In our project we use manual and unit tests.

### Process

1. Make sure everything is stable in your branch before the merge:
- Do manual testing.
- Create your own unit test to test your feature, if it is needed.
2. Create a Pull Request.
3. Get approval from reviewers.
4. Merge.
5. If you found a bug, create a new issue.


## Work with issues and pull requests

### Issues 

1. [How to create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

 1.1 Title:

- Keep your titles short and descriptive.

 1.2 Description:

- Include links to the specific application views you’re describing.
- Context: explain the conditions which led you to write this issue. For example: “Since we’ve moved to the latest version of smth, we’ve experienced a few performance issues (#14 and #15) on production.”
- Use @mentions and references inside of Issues, for notifying other GitHub users and teams, and cross-connect issues to each other. Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two, example:

>This is subtask for #2

  1.3 Use color-coded labels, they help us categorize and filter our issues. You can [create your own label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label).

  1.4 When you decide that you will complet an issue, you should add yourself in the "Assignees" section.

2. Avoid duplication in issues (delete one of them if you have already duplicated it).

Read about issue estimation in [SCRUM_PROCESS.md](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/blob/master/docs/SCRUM_PROCESS.md) file.

### Pull Request

1. [How to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

  1.1 Pull request title: 

The pull request’s name should tell the changes itself generally, to give an overview idea of what the pull request is about.

  1.2 Pull request’s description: 

Should answer the following questions:

WHY — Which tickets/issues/proposals you are working on?

WHAT — What have you done?

HOW — What the reviewers should know?

  1.3 Add Linked issue.
  1.4 Add Project in the Project section.
  1.5 Add yourself in the "Assignees" section.

2. A list of reviewers does not change for every sprint.
3. Use Labels if necessary. [Create label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label), if there's no label that you want to use
4. Don't set a Milestone.

#### Reviewing process

1. If you do not like the existing implementation - suggest your implementation and justify why it is better.
2. Only the person, who opened a conversation (left first comment) can resolve it.
3. Merge pull request can only a person, who created a pull request.
