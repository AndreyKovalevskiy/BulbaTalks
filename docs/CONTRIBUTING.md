## Work with branches

We use [git-flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

The central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime as in [git-flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#the-main-branches). As [supporting branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#supporting-branches) we use branches with a limited lifetime: 

1. [Feature branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#feature-branches).

Name brunch as `feature-[issue number]` (for example, `feature-59`)

2. [Release branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#release-branches).

Name branch as `release-[version number in format X.Y+1]` (for example, `release-1.2`)

3. [Hotfix branches](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#hotfix-branches).

Name branch as `hotfix-[version number in format X.Y.(Z+1)]` (for example, `hotfix-1.0.2`)

## Work with commits

### Commit Message

1. Use the present tense.
2. Use the imperative in the title. For example, you can start the title with these words: Refactor, Update, Remove, Release, Fix, Merge, Rename, etc.
3. Start your message with an uppercase letter.
4. Write in English.
5. The first line of your commit message must be maximum 50 characters long. If you need more verbose description, write the first line as a summary, leave a blank line and then start writing the description. Each line in the description should though wrap at the 72nd mark.

**Recommendation for creating commits**

1. Try to avoid using `git commit .`. Instead, try to get into the habit of checking which files are actually changed (with git status), and then add files to your commits explicitly: `git add {file1} {file2}`.
2. When you work on local machine and you’ve created a commit already, but then you do more work that should logically be included in that same commit, you can simply add new work to the previous commit with `git commit --amend`. Cannot be used if the commit was sent to a remote server.

## Work with versions

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Work with testing

In our project we use manual and unit tests.

## Work with issues and pull requests

### Issues 

1. [Create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue):

   - Keep your titles short and descriptive.
   - Include links to the specific application views you’re describing.
   - Context: explain the conditions which led you to write this issue. For example: “Since we’ve moved to the latest version of smth, we’ve experienced a few performance issues (#14 and #15) on production.”
   - Use color-coded labels, they help us categorize and filter our issues. You can [create your own label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label).
   - Use @mentions and references inside of Issues, for notifying other GitHub users and teams, and cross-connect issues to each other. Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two, example:

>This is subtask for #2

2. Avoid duplication in issues (delete one of them if you have already duplicated it).

3. When you decide that you will complet an issue, you should add yourself in the "Assignees" section.

Read about issue estimation in the [SCRUM_PROCESS.md](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/blob/master/docs/SCRUM_PROCESS.md) file.

4. The issue will closed, when PR merging

### Pull Request

1. [How to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request):

   - The pull request’s title should tell the changes itself generally, to give an overview idea of what the pull request is about.

   - Pull request’s description should answer the following questions:
     + WHY — Which tickets/issues/proposals you are working on?
     + WHAT — What have you done?
     + HOW — What the reviewers should know?

   - Add [Linked issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
  
   - Add Project in the Project section.
  
   - Add yourself in the "Assignees" section.
   - Use @mentions and references inside of Issues, for notifying other GitHub users and teams, and cross-connect issues to each other. Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two, example:

2. Use the same Labels as in issues. [Create label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label), if there's no label that you want to use
3. Don't set a Milestone.

#### Reviewing process

1. If you do not like the existing implementation - suggest your implementation and justify why it is better.
2. Only the person, who opened a conversation (left first comment) can resolve it. 
3. Approve PR if all conversations are resolved and you have no questions.
4. Merge pull request can only a person, who created a pull request. if the author of PR is absent and can't work merging is done by the person who replaces him.
5. Change keywords before merging (https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)

**We use the Scrum framework for developing the product. Read more about when and how we can drag the issue between the columns on Agile board in [SCRUM_PROCESS.md file](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/blob/master/docs/SCRUM_PROCESS.md)**
