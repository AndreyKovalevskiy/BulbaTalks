### **Scrum Events**    
### The Sprint    

Sprints consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. Sprints are lasts one week.  

**Sprint Planning**
Sprint Planning is creating of Product Backlog items which should be done in Sprint by Development Team to achieve the Sprint Goal.  
Sprint Goal is established reference point for Sprint that will be achieved through the execution of a part of Product Backlog items.   
Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of two hours for a one-week Sprint.  

Here you can find current status of the Sprint Goal [Sprint notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxbVa85ZyZQN0tlnibdIgxR1PC301dWRXumpPnWi33w/edit)

### Daily Scrum  
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.   
During the meeting, each member of the Development Team explain:  
1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?  
2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?  
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
Sprint Goal?
