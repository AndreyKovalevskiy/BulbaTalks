## Scrum Events

### The Sprint

We work with sprints as described in [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100) with some specific details:

  - our sprints last one week.

  - sprint starts on Thursday and ends on the next Friday.

  - if the beginning or end of the Sprint is public holiday, the team should agree on the updated date during the sprint planning.

**Sprint Planning**

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of two hours for a one-week Sprint.

### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. On the Daily Scrum meeting we discuss the questions in the same way as described in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100).

## **Scrum Artifacts**

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Our Scrum Team has a Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment and works with them in the same way as described in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100).

## Dragging the issue between the columns on [Agile board](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/projects/1)

Agile board consists of five columns that describe every step of the process: **Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, **In Progress**, **PR**, **Done**.

**Backlog** - an ordered list of known product requirements.

**Sprint Backlog** - a set of Backlog issues that are taken in Sprint.

**In Progress** - the issue is currently being worked on.

**PR** - the issue is request review from collaborators.

**Done** - the issues have been completed.

When dragging issue between the columns on Agile board it changes the status of issue.
1. When developer assignees issue he dragging it **In Progress**, it means he starts to work.

1. After the work is done he opens a new PR and requests review from collaborators, it means that the issue can be dragged to **PR**.

1. If all reviewers approve the task and it is merged, the task must be dragged in the **Done** section.
